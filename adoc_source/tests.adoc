== Description ==

This is a set of tests for the G-Queue library, which checks the correctness of the library's work and endurance under wrong conditions.


== Tests framework ==

The test for the library is created without any testing framework and consists of a set of functions that are called in the main() function.

== Tests' list ==

**Test 1:** Tests if no errors occurred on creating and destroying the Queue.

**Test 2:** Tests if error of wrong size occurred on creating the Queue with size lesser than 1.

**Test 3:** Tests if no errors occurred on enqueueing into the Queue.

**Test 4:** Tests if error of full queue occurred on enqueueing into the full Queue.

**Test 5:** Tests if no errors occurred on peeking the Queue. The test uses also enqueueing, because successful peeking is not possible without enqueueing.

**Test 6:** Tests if error of empty queue occurred on peeking the Queue.

**Test 7:** Tests if no errors occurred on dequeueing the Queue. The test uses also enqueueing, because successful dequeueing is not possible without enqueueing.

**Test 8:** Tests if error of empty queue occurred on dequeueing the empty Queue.
